    <p class="para1">
        I am currently 19 years old. I have worked on many team projects during school and so have learnt how to work in a team. I've passed college with a Bachelors degree
        and now seek to impact the programming world. I am an introvert and therefore have time to work.<br><br>
    <p/>
    <p class="para2">
        I would love to work in the gaming industry and one day make a game that will help people to escape from the harshness of this world. I want to inspire and encourage
        while creating. Passion, the love for games and Aslan  inspire me to do my work. To strive to take gaming to new levels.<br><br>

        I've had some experience in the work environment. I've worked at multiple places during the holidays and so I understand some of the procedures that go on in a
        work environment and that there is always an opportunity to learn.<br><br>
